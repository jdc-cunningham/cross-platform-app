# Another pointless app
This will be an app for myself, it's a starting "foundation". It will be a desktop app for Windows/Linux and a React Native Anrdoid app using the cross platform technologies Electron and React Native.

I know, I know... just use a website... ReactJS and some backend... why why why... I don't know why. I want an app for some reason and not PWA but an app. I have to turn a PWA back into a React Native app anyway so this will be good practice.

I'm just doing crash courses, initially then I'll do my actual app.

The goal though is to share code when possible, the back end particularly regarding the REST API and data store.
