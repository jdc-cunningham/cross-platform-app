- [x] drawing app (06/15/2023)
    - got this great [starter code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2368784/draw-on-html5-canvas-using-a-mouse) here, figured out how to make it with my drawing tablet, this will be embedded for basic drawings
    - it'll be interesting figuring out how to save data
    - possible to save to image, looking into keeping drawing

also thinking about app vs. web... specifically full screen for when in tablet mode/folded over

oh no this one has an offset problem

well now is the time...

oh dang, when you load an image, have to clear existing canvas first
