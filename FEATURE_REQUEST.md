### Desktop
- [ ] some kind of "last doing" tab
- [ ] processing events
- [ ] previous active notes

### Shared
- [ ] way to update last active tab across devices
    - so you edit something on one device, the other device loads it
- [ ] tabs/alternate names for the same entry
    - eg. Machine Learning -> ML
- [ ] grouping new posts in same parent
    - this is useful for organization
    - can revisit something and add more notes but not stack ontop of main entry
    - would be collapsible cards but nested inside parent card
